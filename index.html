    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The internet, as we know it today, has undergone a tremendous evolution. From its humble beginnings as a military
        research project to becoming an integral part of daily life, the journey has been fascinating. Web servers, the
        backbone of the web, have played a pivotal role in enabling this transformation.</p>

    <h2>The Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>The internet traces its roots to the 1960s when ARPANET, a network funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, was
        developed. ARPANET's primary goal was to enable computers to communicate over vast distances. The first
        successful communication occurred in 1969 between computers at UCLA and Stanford.</p>

    <h2>The Advent of Web Servers</h2>
    <p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed the World Wide Web, and in 1990, he developed the first web server, known as
        CERN httpd. This server, running on a NeXT computer, facilitated the sharing of hypertext documents across
        networks. The invention of the web server marked the beginning of the internet as a tool for information
        sharing.</p>

    <h2>Growth of Web Technology</h2>
    <p>During the 1990s, web servers became more advanced and widely adopted. Apache HTTP Server, launched in 1995,
        emerged as one of the most popular open-source web servers and remains a significant player today. The rise of
        commercial web hosting and improved server technology paved the way for e-commerce, social media, and streaming
        services.</p>

    <h2>The Modern Era</h2>
    <p>Today, web servers power countless websites, applications, and services. Technologies such as cloud computing,
        virtualization, and serverless architectures have revolutionized the way web servers operate. Companies like
        Amazon, Google, and Microsoft provide scalable web server solutions that cater to millions of users
        worldwide.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The history of web servers and the internet is a testament to human ingenuity and innovation. From a small
        network connecting a few computers to a global phenomenon influencing every aspect of life, the journey has been
        remarkable. As we continue to innovate, the future of web technology promises even more exciting
        developments.</p>
